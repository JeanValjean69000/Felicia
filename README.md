ü§ñ MemeSentinel ‚Äì Memecoin Trend and Profitability Prediction AI üöÄ

MemeSentinel is an advanced artificial intelligence system designed to analyze social media trends, on-chain wallet activity, and market dynamics to predict profitable memecoins. By leveraging big data analytics, real-time data scraping, and machine learning models, MemeSentinel can identify emerging cryptocurrency trends and provide actionable insights. The code's concept is inspired by BlackRock's Aladdin tool but tailored to the world of memecoins.

üõ†Ô∏è System Architecture:
MemeSentinel is built with a highly modular, scalable, and distributed architecture that handles real-time data streaming, data processing, and machine learning tasks. The system is designed to be flexible for adding new data sources or integrating advanced prediction models.

Data Collection & Scraping:
Real-time data ingestion using official APIs from TikTok, Twitter, and Etherscan.

Web scraping is employed to collect data from trending pages, as many platforms have limited API access or rate-limiting issues.

Data Processing & Feature Engineering:
High-frequency data is cleaned and normalized using distributed processing tools like Apache Spark or Dask.

Time-series analysis is performed to account for volatility and market changes.

Predictive Modeling:
A combination of supervised machine learning models such as Random Forests, Gradient Boosting Machines, and XGBoost are used.
Advanced techniques like ensemble learning, hyperparameter optimization, and cross-validation are implemented to ensure high prediction accuracy.

Real-Time Monitoring & Alerts:
Continuous tracking of memecoin trends and wallet transactions to identify profitable opportunities.
Real-time alerts are sent via WebSockets, email, or SMS using Twilio API.

Visualization:
Plotly Dash is used to create a real-time dashboard that provides visualization of the analysis, profitability predictions, and trends.

üîç Core Technical Components:

Data Collection and Scraping
The data collection module is responsible for gathering data from social media platforms (TikTok, Twitter) and blockchain data (Etherscan).

1.1. TikTok Scraper:
TikTok's API is limited, so we use a combination of API calls and web scraping to collect trending hashtags and creators. BeautifulSoup is used to parse the HTML content of TikTok's trending page.

import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

class TikTokScraper:
    def __init__(self, api_key):
        self.api_key = api_key
        self.api_url = "https://api.tiktok.com/trending"

    def get_trending(self):
        response = requests.get(self.api_url, params={"api_key": self.api_key})
        data = response.json()
        return [trend['hashtag'] for trend in data['trends']]

    def scrape_trending_page(self, page_url):
        response = requests.get(page_url)
        soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
        return [tag.get_text() for tag in soup.find_all('a', class_='hashtag')]


1.2. Twitter Scraper (Tweepy):
Using Tweepy to connect to the Twitter API and extract trending topics and hashtags related to cryptocurrencies and memecoins.

import tweepy

class TwitterScraper:
    def __init__(self, api_key, api_secret_key):
        auth = tweepy.OAuthHandler(api_key, api_secret_key)
        self.api = tweepy.API(auth)

    def get_trending_hashtags(self, woeid=1):
        trends = self.api.trends_place(woeid)
        return [trend['name'] for trend in trends[0]['trends'] if 'crypto' in trend['name'].lower()]

1.3. Etherscan Blockchain Data Collection:
We use Etherscan API to track transactions related to memecoins, identifying significant wallet movements and whale behavior.

import requests

class OnChainAnalyzer:
    def __init__(self, etherscan_api_key):
        self.api_url = "https://api.etherscan.io/api"
        self.api_key = etherscan_api_key

    def get_wallet_balance(self, wallet_address):
        params = {
            'module': 'account',
            'action': 'balance',
            'address': wallet_address,
            'tag': 'latest',
            'apikey': self.api_key
        }
        response = requests.get(self.api_url, params=params)
        return response.json()['result']
    
    def get_wallet_transactions(self, wallet_address):
        params = {
            'module': 'account',
            'action': 'txlist',
            'address': wallet_address,
            'startblock': 0,
            'endblock': 99999999,
            'sort': 'desc',
            'apikey': self.api_key
        }
        response = requests.get(self.api_url, params=params)
        return response.json()['result']


2. Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

   import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def preprocess_trending_data(trending_data):
    trends_df = pd.DataFrame(trending_data)
    trends_df['normalized_score'] = (trends_df['score'] - trends_df['score'].mean()) / trends_df['score'].std()
    return trends_df

def generate_features(wallet_data, trend_data, market_data):
    features = pd.merge(wallet_data, trend_data, on="coin_id")
    features = pd.merge(features, market_data, on="coin_id")
    features['transaction_count'] = features['transactions'].apply(lambda x: len(x))
    return features

MemeSentinel continues with predictive modeling, real-time alerts, and dashboards for user engagement and decision-making. üöÄü§ñ
